## Introduction

`Recca` (`R` Energy Conversion Chain Analysis) is an `R` package that
enables energy and exergy analysis of energy conversion chains. `Recca`
makes extensive use of a matrix-based Physical Supply Use Table (PSUT)
analysis technique that first appeared in [Heun et al.
[-\@Heun:2018]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.109). This
vignette walks through many of the calculations from [Heun et al.
[-\@Heun:2018]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.109), guided
by section numbers from the paper. We begin by discussing the design
philosophy of the `Recca` package, followed by a discussion of the PSUT
matrices that comprise an energy conversion chain (ECC). Thereafter,
calculation of the input-output structure of an ECC is demonstrated.
Finally, advanced calculations are shown, including changes in final
demand, net energy analysis, industry efficiencies, and energy
footprints.

## Design philosophy

The functions in `Recca` are flexibly designed and useful in many
situations. `Recca`'s flexibility stems from its extensive use of the
`matsbyname` and `matsindf` packages under the hood. Inputs to most
`Recca` functions can be any one of:

1.  matrices (with individual matrices as arguments to `Recca`
    functions),
2.  a list as the first argument (with names in the list indicating
    argument names), or
3.  a data frame (with names of data frame columns, as strings, as
    arguments to `Recca` functions).

Outputs are either named matrices in a list (for 1 and 2 above) or named
columns appended to the input data frame (for 3 above).

Argument names for matrices follow a standard nomenclature. It is
recommended that the default matrix names be used whenever possible,
thereby allowing cleaner code.

## PSUT matrices

(Reference [Heun et al.
[-\@Heun:2018]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.109), Section
2.2.2.)

For the examples that follow, we'll use the `UKEnergy2000tidy` data
frame. Each row of `UKEnergy2000tidy` data frame represents another
datum for a portion of the ECC for the UK in 2000. `UKEnergy2000tidy` is
in a format similar to data from the IEA or other organizations.

For data in the format of `UKEnergy2000tidy`, we can create `S_units`
matrices for each grouping using the `S_units_from_tidy()` function.

```{r}
library(tibble)
S_units <- UKEnergy2000tidy %>%
  dplyr::group_by(Country, Year, Energy.type, Last.stage) %>%
  S_units_from_tidy()
tibble::glimpse(S_units)
```

And we can identify which entries belong in the resource ($\mathbf{R}$),
make ($\mathbf{V}$), use ($\mathbf{U}$), and final demand ($\mathbf{Y}$)
matrices with the `IEATools::add_psut_matnames()` and
`IEATools::add_row_col_meta()` functions.

```{r}
WithNames <- UKEnergy2000tidy %>%
  # Add a column indicating the matrix in which this entry belongs (U, V, or Y).
  IEATools::add_psut_matnames() %>%
  # Add metadata columns for row names, column names, row types, and column types.
  IEATools::add_row_col_meta() %>% 
  # Eliminate columns we no longer need
  dplyr::select(-Ledger.side, -Flow.aggregation.point, -Flow, -Product) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    # Ensure that all energy values are positive, as required for analysis.
    E.dot = abs(E.dot)
  )
head(WithNames)
```

After identifying the matrices, rownames, colnames, rowtypes, and
coltypes, we can collapse all data to matrices and add a unit summation
matrix (`S_units`).

```{r}
AsMats <- WithNames %>%
  # Collapse to matrices using functions in the matsindf package
  dplyr::group_by(Country, Year, Energy.type, Last.stage, matnames) %>%
  matsindf::collapse_to_matrices(matnames = "matnames", matvals = "E.dot",
                       rownames = "rownames", colnames = "colnames",
                       rowtypes = "rowtypes", coltypes = "coltypes") %>%
  dplyr::rename(matrix.name = matnames, matrix = E.dot) %>%
  tidyr::spread(key = matrix.name, value = matrix) %>% 
  # Do a little more cleanup
  dplyr::mutate(
    # Create full U matrix
    U = matsbyname::sum_byname(U_feed, U_EIOU),
    # Create r_EIOU, a matrix that identifies the ratio of EIOU to other energy consumed.
    r_EIOU = matsbyname::quotient_byname(U_EIOU, U),
    r_EIOU = matsbyname::replaceNaN_byname(r_EIOU, val = 0)
  ) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-U_EIOU, -U_feed) %>%
  # Add S_units matrices
  dplyr::left_join(S_units, by = c("Country", "Year", "Energy.type", "Last.stage")) %>%
  tidyr::gather(key = matrix.name, value = matrix, R, U, V, Y, r_EIOU, S_units)
tibble::glimpse(AsMats)
```

The `AsMats` data frame is essentially the same as the
`Recca::UKEnergy2000mats` data frame. The remainder of this vignette
uses the `UKEnergy2000mats` data frame.

## I-O structure

(Reference [Heun et al.
[-\@Heun:2018]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.109), Section
2.2.4.)

### With individual matrices

To determine the I-O structure of an ECC, use the `calc_io_mats()`
function.

```{r}
library(tidyr)
mats <- UKEnergy2000mats %>% 
  tidyr::spread(key = matrix.name, value = matrix) %>% 
  # Put rows in a natural order
  dplyr::mutate(
    Last.stage = factor(Last.stage, levels = c("Final", "Useful", "Services")),
    Energy.type = factor(Energy.type, levels = c("E", "X"))
  ) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(Last.stage, Energy.type)
# Use the calc_io_mats function with individual matrices, 
# each taken from the first row of the UKEnergy2000mats data frame.
R <- mats$R[[1]]
U <- mats$U[[1]]
U_feed = mats$U_feed[[1]]
V <- mats$V[[1]]
Y <- mats$Y[[1]]
S_units <- mats$S_units[[1]]
IO_list <- calc_io_mats(R = R, U = U, U_feed = U_feed, V = V, Y = Y, S_units = S_units)
```

Most `Recca` functions return a list when called with individual
matrices as arguments. The `calc_io_mats()` function gives several I-O
matrices in its returned list.

```{r}
class(IO_list)
names(IO_list)
IO_list[["y"]]
```

The same calculations can be performed by supplying a named list to
`Recca` functions. In this approach, all original data are returned in
the list. So in this case, matrices $\mathbf{U}$, $\mathbf{V}$,
$\mathbf{Y}$, and $\mathbf{S_{units}}$ are also returned from the
`calc_io_mats()` function. When a list is supplied to a `Recca` function
in the `.sutmats` argument, most other input arguments must be strings
that identify the names of appropriate entries in the `.sutmats` list
containing named vectors or matrices. Helpfully, the default values for
other input arguments conform to a standard nomenclature. When using the
standard nomenclature, most `Recca` functions can use the default
arguments for input and output items in the list.

```{r}
IO_from_list <- calc_io_mats(list(R = R, U = U, U_feed = U_feed, V = V, Y = Y, S_units = S_units))
class(IO_from_list)
names(IO_from_list)
IO_from_list[["y"]]
```

### From a `matsindf`-style data frame

Most `Recca` functions can also operate on a `matsindf`-style data
frame. (A `matsindf`-style data frame has matrices in cells of a data
frame. See the `matsindf` package for additional information.) When a
data frame is supplied to a `Recca` function in the `.sutmats` argument,
most other input arguments must be strings that identify the names of
appropriate columns in `.sutmats` containing named vectors or matrices.
Helpfully, the default values for other input arguments conform to a
standard nomenclature. When using the standard nomenclature, most
`Recca` functions can use the default arguments for input and output
columns. This approach yields very clean piped code, as shown below.

To illustrate the above features of `Recca` functions, we'll apply the
`calc_io_mats` function to the entire `UKEnergy2000mats` data frame,
calculating appropriate I-O matrices for each row. Used in this way,
`Recca` functions act like specialized `dplyr::mutate()` functions, with
new columns added to the right side of the data frame supplied to the
`.sutmats` argument.

```{r}
IO_df <- mats %>% calc_io_mats()
```

By inspecting `IO_df`, we can see, for example, that one $\mathbf{y}$
vector was calculated for each of the four rows of `mats`. The same is
true for all I-O matrices calculated by `calc_io_mats`.

```{r}
class(IO_df)
names(IO_df)
glimpse(IO_df)
IO_df[["y"]][[1]]
IO_df[["y"]][[4]]
```

For the remainder of this vignette, operations will be performed on the
entire `UKEnergy2000mats` data frame. But readers should remember that
functions can be called on named lists or individual matrices, as well.

## Changes in final demand

(Reference [Heun et al.
[-\@Heun:2018]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.109), Section
2.2.5.)

One of the first applications of input-output analysis was estimating
changes in industry outputs that would be required to meet new final
demand. `Recca` allows similar calculations on energy conversion chains
with the function `new_Y()`. Arguments to `new_Y()` include matrices
that describe the input-output structure of the ECC and `Y_prime`, the
new final demand matrix. `new_Y()` calculates `U_prime` and `V_prime`
matrices which represent the ECC that would be required to meet the new
final demand represented by `Y_prime`.

```{r}
Double_demand <- IO_df %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(
    Y_prime = matsbyname::hadamardproduct_byname(2, Y)
  ) %>% 
  new_Y()
names(Double_demand)
IO_df[["Y"]][[1]][ , c(1,2)]
Double_demand[["Y_prime"]][[1]]
IO_df[["U"]][[1]][ , c("Crude dist.", "Diesel dist.")]
Double_demand[["U_prime"]][[1]][ , c("Crude dist.", "Diesel dist.")]
```

See the vignette for the [`new_*()` functions](new-functions.html) for
more details.

## Net energy analysis

(Reference [Heun et al.
[-\@Heun:2018]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.109), Section
3.1.)

The energy production system itself consumes energy, and important
metrics for energy conversion chain industries are energy return ratios
(ERRs). `Recca` provides a function to calculate three ERRs, a gross
energy ratio (GER), a net energy ratio (NER), and the ratio of NER to
GER. GER is commonly called energy return on investment (EROI). (See
[Brandt & Dale [-\@Brandt:2011]](https://doi.org/10.3390/en4081211).)
These ERRs can be calculated for a variety of system boundaries. ERRs
for the $\gamma$ system boundary can be calculated readily using the
`calc_ERRs_gamma()` function. All three ERRs are calculated at the same
time. The ERRs are `NA` for industries in which inputs or outputs are
unit-inhomogeneous. The ERRs are `Inf` for industries that make an
energy product without consuming any energy from another processing
chain (such as the Elect. grid). The results below are identical to Fig.
6 in [Heun et al.
[-\@Heun:2018]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.109).

```{r}
ERRs <- IO_df %>% 
  calc_ERRs_gamma()
ERRs$ger_gamma[[1]]
ERRs$ner_gamma[[1]]
ERRs$r_gamma[[1]]
```

## Efficiencies

(Reference [Heun et al.
[-\@Heun:2018]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.109), Section
3.2.)

The efficiency of every industry in the ECC can be calculated quickly
with the `calc_eta_i()` function, which creates a column named `eta_i`
(by default) at the right of the data frame. If a particular ECC has
industries whose inputs or outputs are unit inhomogeneous, the `eta_i`
vector will have `NA` values in the appropriate places. The results
below are identical to Fig. 9 in [Heun et al.
[-\@Heun:2018]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.109).

```{r}
etas <- IO_df %>% 
  calc_eta_i()
names(etas)
etas[["eta_i"]][[1]]
etas[["eta_i"]][[3]] # NAs indicate inhomogeneous units on inputs or outputs.
```

## Energy footprints

(Reference [Heun et al.
[-\@Heun:2018]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.109), Section
3.3.)

Final demand for energy contains embodied primary energy, the sum of all
primary energy consumed and wasted throughout the ECC in the process of
satisfying that final demand. `Recca` provides two functions to
calculate embodied primary energy and important ratios, namely
`calc_embodied_mats()` and `calc_embodied_etas()`.

The function `calc_embodied_mats()` calculates embodied energy in final
demand products ($p$) and final demand sectors ($s$).

Outputs from `calc_embodied_mats()` include the following matrices:

+--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+

`calc_embodied_mats()` also calculates $\mathbf{F}_{footprint}$ and
$\mathbf{F}_{effects}$ matrices, which answer the questions
(respectively) "What is the fractional composition of embodied energy of
each final demand energy type?" and "What is the fractional destination
of a given upstream energy product?" The calculations can be performed
for each final demand product or each final demand sector. The following
table describes these matrices.

Finally, embodied energy efficiencies can be calculated as final demand
energy divided by embodied energy. Again, efficiencies can be calculated
for each final demand product or each final demand sector. The
`calc_embodied_etas()` function does this computation.

Figure 15 in [Heun et al.
[-\@Heun:2018]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.109) shows
primary-to-services energetic efficiencies for the ECC in the 3rd row of
`IO_df`. The following code extracts those results. Rows of the vector
give final demand services and their units. The column gives
efficiencies in units of service per ktoe of energy.

## Conclusion

This vignette demonstrated the use of the `Recca` package. `Recca`
provides many useful functions for analyzing energy conversion chains
within the PSUT framework first described in [Heun et al.
[-\@Heun:2018]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.109).
