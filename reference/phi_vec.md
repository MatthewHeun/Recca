# A vector of phi (exergy-to-energy ratios) values

Converting from energy to exergy requires vectors of phi values. This
object is a vector to assist that conversion process for the
`UKEnergy2000mats` energy conversion chain bundled with this package.

## Usage

``` r
phi_vec
```

## Format

A matrix with energy products in rows and phi values in a single column.
