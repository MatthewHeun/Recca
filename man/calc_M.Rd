\usage{
calc_M(.YqGHEdata = NULL, Y_colname = "Y", q_colname = "q",
  G_colname = "G", E_colname = "E", tol = 1e-04, M_p_colname = "M_p",
  M_s_colname = "M_s")
}
\arguments{
\item{.YqGHEdata}{a data frame containing columns with \code{q} vectors
and \code{Y}, \code{G}, \code{H}, and \code{E} matrices.
\code{.YqGEdata} will likely have been obtained from the \code{calc_G} and \code{calc_E} functions.}

\item{Y_colname}{the name of the output column containing \code{Y} matrices.
\code{Y} is the final demand matrix.}

\item{q_colname}{the name of the output column containing \code{q} column vectors.
\code{q} is calculated by \code{Ui} + \code{y}.}

\item{G_colname}{the name of the output column containing \code{G} matrices.
\code{G} is calculated by \code{L_ixp} * \code{y_hat}.}

\item{E_colname}{the name of the output column containing \code{E} matrices.
\code{E} is calculated by \code{W} * \code{g_hat_inv}.}

\item{tol}{the allowable energy balance error.
\code{Q} is calculated by \code{e_hat * G},
but the e_hat column contains lists of matrices,
so the \code{Q} column will also contain lists of matrices.
In each list, there is one Q matrix for each Product in the Energy Conversion Chain.}

\item{M_p_colname}{the name of the output column containing matrices of embodied energy in products.
These matrices contain embodied products in rows and embodying products in columns.}

\item{M_s_colname}{the name of the output column containing matrices of embodied energy consumed by final demand sectors.
These matrices contain embodied products in rows and consuming final demand sectors in columns.}
