\title{Confirm that an SUT-style data frame conserves energy.}
\usage{
verify_SUT_energy_balance_with_units(.sutdata, U = "U", V = "V", Y = "Y",
  S_units = "S_units", tol = 1e-06)
}
\arguments{
\item{.sutdata}{an SUT-style data frame containing metadata columns
(typically \code{Country}, \code{Year}, \code{Ledger.side}, \code{Product}, etc.)
and columns of matrices, including
\code{U}, \code{V}, and \code{Y}.}

\item{U}{the name of the column that contains \code{U} matrices}

\item{V}{the name of the column that contains \code{V} matrices}

\item{Y}{the name of the column that contains \code{Y} matrices}

\item{S_units}{the name of the column that contains \code{S_units} matrices}

\item{tol}{the maximum amount by which Supply and Consumption can be out of balance}
}
\value{
Nothing is returned.
This function should be called
for its side-effect of testing whether energy is in balance in \code{.sutdata}.
}
\description{
Energy balances are confirmed by Product (within \code{tol}) for every row in .sutdata.
If energy is in balance for every row, no message is given, and
execution returns to the caller.
If energy balance is not observed for any combination of Country, Year, and Product, etc.,
a message is printed which shows the first few non-balancing Products, and
execution halts.
