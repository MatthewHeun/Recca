\description{
A dataset containing approximations to
some of the energy flows in the UK in the year 2000.
These data first appeared as the example in
Figures 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, B.1, and B.2 of
M.K. Heun, A. Owen, and P. E. Brockway.
A physical supply-use table framework for energy analysis on the energy conversion chain.
Applied Energy, 226:1134â€“1162, Sep 2018.
