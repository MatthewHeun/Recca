# Recca


## Statement of Need

Societal energy analysis and societal exergy analysis (SEA)
make extensive use of the energy conversion chain (ECC), 
a description of energy flows through society 
from the primary stage 
(resources extracted from the environment, 
such as coal, oil, natural gas, wind, and solar),
to the final stage
(energy purchased by consumers, 
such as refined petroleum and electricity),
to the useful stage
(energy desired by the end user, 
such as heat, motion, and light),
and sometimes to energy services
(such as thermal comfort, transport, and illumination).
Such analyses are significantly easier 
when data are arranged in the 
**R**, **U**, **V**, and **Y** matrices
of the PSUT framework described by 
[Heun et al.
[-@Heun:2018]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.109).

To facilitate SEA with the PSUT framework,
computational tools are needed.
The computational tools should be amenable to 
use with [matsindf](https://MatthewHeun.github.io/matsindf/)
data frames of ECC matrices
and written with plain names for functions and data..
The `Recca` package provides 
such computational tools.


## Installation

You can install `Recca` from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install devtools if not already installed
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MatthewHeun/Recca")
# To build vignettes locally, use
devtools::install_github("MatthewHeun/Recca", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```


## History

The functions in this package were first used in the paper 
[Heun et al. [-@Heun:2018]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.109).
